<h2>tnyOS- A fun hobby OS that doesn't crash... Often </h2>
tnyOs is a very basic kernel (not really and OS yet) that has minimal code that is easy to digest. I suggest reading this code along with guides such as The Little Book about OS Development.

<h2>Buiding and emulating</h2>
First install QUEMU, then run build.sh in the /tnyOS directory, finally run the command in QUEMU_command to emulate the kernel.

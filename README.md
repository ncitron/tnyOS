<h2>tnyOS- A fun hobby OS that doesn't crash... Often </h2>
tnyOs is a very basic kernel that has minimal code that is (hopefuly) easy to digest. I suggest reading this code along with guides such as The Little Book about OS Development.

<h2>Buiding and emulating</h2>
First install QEMU, then run start.sh in the /tnyOS directory. Alternatively you can run build/build.sh and use your prefered emulator to run the resulting kernel object. This is only tested with qemu on linux, please only run this on a virtual machine.
